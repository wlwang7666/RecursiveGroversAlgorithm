# RecursiveGroversAlgorithm
The recursive algorithm is to create the quantum circuits for Grover's algorithm through recursion. The algorithm intends to save the efforts of creating the multiple qubits NOT gate. This is because the number of required quantum gates will increase exponentionaly with only a linear growth of the number of qubits.

A non-recursive algorithm is also included to facilitate verification. The recursive algorithm yields a competitive performance as the non-recursive one but can save efforts in manually optimizing the composition of the gates.
